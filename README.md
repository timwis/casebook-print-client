## How does it work?
[Stylus][stylus] is a browser extension that allows you to customise the layout of specific webpages in your own browser. For instance, you could make the background of google.com pink, and every time you go there it will be pink until you disable it. Your customisations only affect your browser, but you can share your customisations with other people who have Stylus installed. This project is a shared customisation for Casebook. Customisations like this have no special access: they just alter the page's layout within your browser.
